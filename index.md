# Adaptics Engine
Adaptics Engine, our core technology, is built using Rust. It is designed to be device agnostic, but currently targets [Ultrahaptics devices](https://www.ultraleap.com/datasheets/STRATOS_Explore_Development_Kit_datasheet.pdf).
The engine offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), a C-compatible API, and C# bindings to facilitate playback of adaptive haptic patterns. Please note that the latest releases are available only for Windows at this time.
