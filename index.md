# [Adaptics Engine](https://github.com/AdaptiveHaptics/AdapticsEngine)

Adaptics Engine repository comprises two packages: `adaptics-engine` and `adaptics-pattern-evaluator`.

`adaptics-engine` offers a Command Line Interface (CLI) that runs a websocket server for real-time pattern playback from the Designer, supplemented with a C-compatible API and C# bindings. It is designed to be hardware agnostic, but currently targets [Ultraleap haptics devices](https://www.ultraleap.com/datasheets/STRATOS_Explore_Development_Kit_datasheet.pdf).

`adaptics-pattern-evaluator` facilitates the low-level evaluation of Adaptics patterns, and is incorporated into both the `adaptics-engine` and the Designer.
